./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000001.wav|Sculpture he regards as 'Painting's poor relation'; so, with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the 'rough modelling' of Tanagra figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts; but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000006.wav|That there is a difference between colour and colours, that an artist, be he portrait painter or dramatist, always reveals himself in his manner, are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him; but mr Quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art, with the exception of mr Whistler.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000007.wav|Painting, he tells us, is 'of a different quality to mathematics,' and finish in art is 'adding more fact'!
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000008.wav|Portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy; however, even for the emotional artist there is hope, as a portrait can be converted into a picture 'by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct'!

./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000030_000000.wav|"Of course," said Kaliko.

./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000036_000002.wav|But is my dear brother well?" he added anxiously.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000038_000000.wav|"I hope he doesn't work too hard," said Shaggy.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000039_000000.wav|"He doesn't work at all.

./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000047_000000.wav|Kaliko hesitated.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000051_000000.wav|"Do you suppose Ruggedo destroyed them?"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000052_000000.wav|"Oh, no; I'm quite sure he didn't.

./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000053_000000.wav|"That's funny," remarked Betsy thoughtfully.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000053_000002.wav|But to disappear like that seems like magic; now, doesn't it?"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000054_000000.wav|They agreed that it did, but no one could explain the mystery.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000055_000000.wav|"However," said Shaggy, "they are gone, that is certain, so we cannot help them or be helped by them.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000058_000000.wav|Betsy laughed and Shaggy seemed rather hurt; but Polychrome relieved his embarrassment by saying softly: "One can be ugly in looks, but lovely in disposition."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000060_000000.wav|"True," agreed Kaliko.
