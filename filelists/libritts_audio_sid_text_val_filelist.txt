./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000003_000000.wav|0|There is a healthy bank holiday atmosphere about this book which is extremely pleasant.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000003_000001.wav|0|mr Quilter is entirely free from affectation of any kind.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000003_000002.wav|0|He rollicks through art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000003_000003.wav|0|To many, no doubt, he will seem to be somewhat blatant and bumptious, but we prefer to regard him as being simply British.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000003_000005.wav|0|After listening so long to the Don Quixote of art, to listen once to Sancho Panza is both salutary and refreshing.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000000.wav|0|About artists and their work mr Quilter has, of course, a great deal to say.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000001.wav|0|Sculpture he regards as 'Painting's poor relation'; so, with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the 'rough modelling' of Tanagra figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts; but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000006.wav|0|That there is a difference between colour and colours, that an artist, be he portrait painter or dramatist, always reveals himself in his manner, are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him; but mr Quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art, with the exception of mr Whistler.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000007.wav|0|Painting, he tells us, is 'of a different quality to mathematics,' and finish in art is 'adding more fact'!
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000008.wav|0|Portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy; however, even for the emotional artist there is hope, as a portrait can be converted into a picture 'by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct'!
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000009.wav|0|As for etchings, they are of two kinds-British and foreign.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000013.wav|0|And then the picture he draws of the ideal home, where everything, though ugly, is hallowed by domestic memories, and where beauty appeals not to the heartless eye but the family affections; 'baby's chair there, and the mother's work basket . . . near the fire, and the ornaments Fred brought home from India on the mantel board'!
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000005_000014.wav|0|It is really impossible not to be touched by so charming a description.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000006_000003.wav|0|Far from it.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000006_000008.wav|0|On the whole, the book will not do.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/128104/1272_128104_000006_000009.wav|0|We fully admit that it is extremely amusing and, no doubt, mr Quilter is quite earnest in his endeavours to elevate art to the dignity of manual labour, but the extraordinary vulgarity of the style alone will always be sufficient to prevent these Sententiae Artis from being anything more than curiosities of literature. mr Quilter has missed his chance; for he has failed even to make himself the Tupper of Painting.

./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000005_000000.wav|0|"Don't worry," replied Quox.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000007_000001.wav|0|Next instant Shaggy was himself again and Quox said to him grumblingly:
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000008_000000.wav|0|"Please get off my left toe, Shaggy Man, and be more particular where you step."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000026_000002.wav|0|Quox did not have much to say until the conversation was ended, but then he turned to Kaliko and asked:
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000028_000000.wav|0|"Me?" stammered the Chamberlain, greatly surprised by the question. "Well, I couldn't be a worse King, I'm sure."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000030_000000.wav|0|"Of course," said Kaliko.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000032_000000.wav|0|"Hooray!" cried Betsy; "I'm glad of that.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000035_000000.wav|0|"The Ugly One?
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000035_000001.wav|0|Very willingly," replied Kaliko.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000036_000002.wav|0|But is my dear brother well?" he added anxiously.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000038_000000.wav|0|"I hope he doesn't work too hard," said Shaggy.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000039_000000.wav|0|"He doesn't work at all.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000041_000000.wav|0|"Not exactly," returned Kaliko.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000043_000000.wav|0|"In the Metal Forest."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000044_000000.wav|0|"Where is that?"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000045_000002.wav|0|All the trees are gold and silver and the ground is strewn with precious stones, so it is a sort of treasury."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000047_000000.wav|0|Kaliko hesitated.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000051_000000.wav|0|"Do you suppose Ruggedo destroyed them?"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000052_000000.wav|0|"Oh, no; I'm quite sure he didn't.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000052_000001.wav|0|They fell into the big pit in the passage, and we put the cover on to keep them there; but when the executioners went to look for them they had all disappeared from the pit and we could find no trace of them."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000053_000000.wav|0|"That's funny," remarked Betsy thoughtfully.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000053_000002.wav|0|But to disappear like that seems like magic; now, doesn't it?"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000054_000000.wav|0|They agreed that it did, but no one could explain the mystery.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000055_000000.wav|0|"However," said Shaggy, "they are gone, that is certain, so we cannot help them or be helped by them.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000058_000000.wav|0|Betsy laughed and Shaggy seemed rather hurt; but Polychrome relieved his embarrassment by saying softly: "One can be ugly in looks, but lovely in disposition."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000060_000000.wav|0|"True," agreed Kaliko.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000060_000001.wav|0|"So I think I will assemble the chief nomes of my kingdom in this throne room and tell them that I am their new King. Then I can ask them to assist us in searching for the secret passages.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/135031/1272_135031_000063_000000.wav|0|"Of course not," said he, jumping up from the throne, where he had seated himself.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000002_000000.wav|0|For my Mother and Father-

./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000007_000003.wav|0|And when he attacked, it was always there to beat him aside.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000008_000001.wav|0|He reacted-but his blade just met air.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000010_000000.wav|0|"One minute," a voice said, and the time buzzer sounded.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000011_000000.wav|0|Brion had carefully conditioned the reflex in himself.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000011_000002.wav|0|The buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000011_000003.wav|0|Only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong, measured rate.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000011_000004.wav|0|His eyes closed and he was only distantly aware of his handlers catching him as he fell, carrying him to his bench. While they massaged his limp body and cleansed the wound, all of his attention was turned inward.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000011_000006.wav|0|The nagging memory of the previous night loomed up then, and he turned it over and over in his mind, examining it from all sides.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000012_000001.wav|0|The contestants in the Twenties needed undisturbed rest, therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000012_000003.wav|0|But as soon as the scores began to mount and eliminations cut into their ranks, there was complete silence after dark.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000012_000004.wav|0|Particularly so on this last night, when only two of the little cubicles were occupied, the thousands of others standing with dark, empty doors.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000013_000001.wav|0|The words were whispered but clear-two voices, just outside the thin metal of his door.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000013_000002.wav|0|Someone spoke his name.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000014_000001.wav|0|Of course not.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000014_000002.wav|0|Whoever said you could was making a big mistake and there is going to be trouble-"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000015_000000.wav|0|"Don't talk like an idiot!"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000015_000001.wav|0|The other voice snapped with a harsh urgency, clearly used to command.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000015_000003.wav|0|Now stand aside!"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000018_000001.wav|0|He must have drawn his gun, because the intruder said quickly, "Put that away.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000018_000002.wav|0|You're being a fool!"
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000019_000000.wav|0|"Out!" was the single snarled word of the response.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000019_000001.wav|0|There was silence then and, still wondering, Brion was once more asleep.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000020_000000.wav|0|"Ten seconds."
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000021_000001.wav|0|He was unhappily conscious of his total exhaustion.

./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000021_000003.wav|0|It would be hard to stay on his feet, much less summon the strength and skill to fight and win a touch.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000022_000000.wav|0|"How do we stand?" he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000023_000000.wav|0|"Four four.
./data/LibriTTS/dev-clean/1272/141231/1272_141231_000023_000001.wav|0|All you need is a touch to win!"
